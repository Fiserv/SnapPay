APIs without User Interaction
=============================

API â€“ Charge
------------

The Charge API performs a credit card charge or payment using a credit card token to insure the credit card is valid, has the requested credit limit available and to initiate the transfer of funds. This performs the functions of the Authorize API and Capture API in a single call.
